# Dual Grid Tilemap
Dual Grid Tilemap is an alternative way to auto-tiling that doesn't require a lot of tiles. I took information about this system from the Youtube channel “jess::code” to create my implementation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEWFSv3ivTg.

# How to use
- Middle (wheel) mouse butoon - reset view size
- Mouse wheel scroll - zoom view
- WASD or arrow keys - move view
